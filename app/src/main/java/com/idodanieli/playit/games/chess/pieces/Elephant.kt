// Despite sounding like a powerful piece, the chaturanga elephant can only move diagonally two squares.
// Like knights, elephants can jump over other pieces.
// The leaping powers of the elephant might seem like a triumph.
// Nevertheless, they can control just four squares at a time, and their regular movement (as opposed to the knight's irregular jump)
// restricts their reachâ€”each elephant can only ever access eight specific squares of the board.
