  "description": "The Grasshopper is a chess piece that moves like a queen along rank, file, and diagonal, but when capturing an opponent's piece, it jumps over it to the next square in the same direction. The Grasshopper cannot move in a direction if there is no piece to hop over, which can limit its mobility."
